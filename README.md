  Edit the `startTimer()` function in `script.js` and set your desired starting time (e.g. `appState.timer = 60;`).
- **Tweak appearance:**

## 🤓 How It Works

- **WPM Calculation:**  
  Uses the standard formula:  
  `WPM = (Correct Characters / 5) / Minutes`
- **Accuracy:**  
  Only perfectly typed characters count as correct.
- **Score Card:**  
  See your WPM at the end and hit "Play Again" to try for a higher score!
